# Pomodoro 

This Python program implements a Pomodoro timer using the Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. After a certain number of work intervals, a longer break is taken.

## How it Works

1. The user can start the timer by clicking the "Start" button. 
2. The timer alternates between work intervals, short breaks, and long breaks based on predefined time durations.
3. The user can reset the timer at any time by clicking the "Reset" button.

## Features

- Timer mechanism for work intervals, short breaks, and long breaks.
- Visual representation of the timer using a tomato image and a countdown display.
- Ability to reset the timer.
- Checkmark display to track completed work intervals.

## Constants

- `WORK_MIN`: Duration of each work interval in minutes.
- `SHORT_BREAK_MIN`: Duration of each short break in minutes.
- `LONG_BREAK_MIN`: Duration of each long break in minutes.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Tkinter library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
